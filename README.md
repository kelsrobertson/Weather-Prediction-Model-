# Weather-Prediction-Model
This project analyzes historical weather data to predict future temperatures using a linear regression model. It includes data cleaning, trend visualization, and model evaluation, helping to understand long-term temperature patterns for more accurate forecasting.

# Overview
- This project uses historical weather data to predict future weather conditions, focusing on temperature trends. Using Python and data science tools, the notebook walks through data cleaning, visualization, and building a predictive model to estimate future temperature values.

# Goals
- Load and clean historical weather data
- Explore and visualize trends in temperature over time
- Train a regression model to predict future temperatures
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy

# Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for linear regression)

# Key Findings
- Clear temperature trends were observed over time, showing seasonal patterns and gradual increases.
- The linear regression model was able to reasonably predict future temperatures based on past data.
- Data cleaning and visualization were essential to improving model accuracy and interpretability.
- The model can be adapted to forecast weather in different locations using similar historical datasets.
