# Weather-Prediction-Model
This project analyzes historical weather data to predict future temperatures using a linear regression model. It includes data cleaning, trend visualization, and model evaluation, helping to understand long-term temperature patterns for more accurate forecasting.

# Overview
- This project uses historical weather data to predict future weather conditions, focusing on temperature trends. Using Python and data science tools, the notebook walks through data cleaning, visualization, and building a predictive model to estimate future temperature values.

# Goals
- Load and clean historical weather data
- Explore and visualize trends in temperature over time
- Train a regression model to predict future temperatures
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy

# Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for linear regression)

# Key Findings
- Clear temperature trends were observed over time, showing seasonal patterns and gradual increases.
- The linear regression model was able to reasonably predict future temperatures based on past data.
- Data cleaning and visualization were essential to improving model accuracy and interpretability.
- The model can be adapted to forecast weather in different locations using similar historical datasets.


## Note About the Notebook File

The original notebook, Final Project – Weather Projection Model.ipynb, exceeds GitHub’s file display and upload limits (202 MB), and is therefore not directly viewable on GitHub.

To allow others to view the code without using Git Large File Storage (LFS), a .py script version of the notebook is included in this repository. This script mirrors the content and logic of the original notebook but excludes outputs and embedded media that caused the file to exceed GitHub’s size restrictions.

If you wish to access or run the full .ipynb notebook version (with outputs):

Clone the repository with Git LFS enabled:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/kelseyrobertson/Weather-Prediction-Model-.git
cd Weather-Prediction-Model-
git lfs install
git lfs pull
Open the notebook locally in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
